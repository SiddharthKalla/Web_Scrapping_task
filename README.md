Now, initialize different lists in which we will save/store the scrapped data and use it after wards.

For the scrapping find the elemennts mostly by their class name and appened the text part in different lists defined by us.

After appending all the lists , use pandas and convert all 4 different lists into 1 data frame to proceed further.
